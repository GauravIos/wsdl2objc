=Elements=
Right now, I'm "cheating" and treating element nodes as type nodes. I don't think this actually makes sense. I think elements are their own thing and should be parsed accordingly. I'm not really sure how to go about doing that, though.

Anyway, the current implementation is just broken. When I get to an element without any subnodes in the wsdl, I treat it as a simple type. This is broken for the following because they're elements pointing to complex types instead:
